The plums tasted sweet to the unlettered desert tribeswoman
What manners to chew into each with such gusto
She was ungainly, low caste, a little dirty
But God took the fruit she'd been sucking
She knew how to love
She might not distinguish splendor from filth
But she tasted the nectar of passion
Might not know any better 
But a chariot swept her away
Now she frolics in heaven, ecstatically bound to her God
The Lord of full and fools 
Says Mirabai, "Love will save anyone who can practice rapture like that."

I myself in a previous birth was a cow-herding girl at Gokul
In my travels I spent time with a great yogi
Once he said to me, "Become so still you hear the blood flowing through your veins"
One night as I sat in quiet, I seemed on the verge of entering a world inside so vast
I know it is the source of all of us

You told your songs to the birds first 
Why was that, oh Divine One?
Did you practice your love in the hearts of animals before you created humans?
I know the planets talk at night and tell secrets about you
A tree limb just moved before me
The beauty of this world is causing me to weep

Something has reached out and taken in the beams of my eyes
There is a longing
It is for his body, for every hair of that dark body
All I was doing was being, and love came by
My love's face looks curiously like the moon
I saw it from the side, smiling
My family says, "Never see him again!" 
And they imply things in a low voice
But my eyes have their own life
They laugh at rules
I know it's him

I believe I can bear on my shoulders whatever you want to save me from
Mirabai says, "How much can love lift on the dark night of the soul? Watch the sky!"

I watched as clouds ruptured ash black and pale
I saw enormous clouds split and spur rain for 2 hours
Everywhere, water, plants and rain
What variety of green on the earth!

My love has gone to a foreign country
Where did I misplace my courage? 
I watched the clouds rupture open
Nothing can harm him
This passion has yet to be slighted
Dark friend, what can I say?
This love I bring from lifetimes is ancient
Do not make me relive it

Seeing your elegant body I am ravished
Visit our courtyard
Where the women sing old hymns in the square 
I've laid out a welcome of teardrops
Body and mind, I surrendered ages ago
Taking refuge wherever your feet pass
Mirabai flees from lifetime to lifetime as your virgin

Go to that impenetrable realm 
That death himself trembles to look upon
There, The Fountain of Love 
With swans sporting on its waters
Where the company of the holy ones is available
There one may talk of spiritual knowledge
There one can meditate on the Lord
And purify one's mind

They want me to bind on the anklets of good conduct
And dance the dance of contentment
They want me to adopt a headdress of gold 
And the sixteen kinds of adornment
Let there be love for the Lord
And indifference to all else

I am mad with love
And no one understands my plight
Only the wounded understand the agonies of the wounded
When the fire rages in the heart
Only the jeweler knows the value of the jewel, not the one who lets it go
In pain, I wander door to door 
But could not find a doctor
Says Mirabai, "Hearken, my master, Mirabai's pain will subside when the Lord comes as the doctor"

I am pale with longing for my beloved
People believe I am ill
Seizing on every possible pretext, I try to meet him by accident
They have sent for a doctor from another country
He grabs my arm and prods it
How can I explain my pain is in my heart?
That I am afflicted?
Go home, country doctor, don't address me by my name 
It's the name of God that has wounded me
Don't force your medicines on me
The sweetness of his lips is the rarest nectar
That's the only cure for which I crave
Mirabai's Lord is Giridhar
He will feed me nectar again and again

I am true to my Lord
O my companions, there is nothing to be ashamed of now  
Since I have been seen openly dancing late in the day
I have no hunger at night, I'm restless and cannot sleep
Leaving these troubles behind, I go to the other side
A hidden knowledge has taken hold of me
My relations surround me like bees
But Mirabai is the servant of her beloved Giridhar 
And she cares nothing that people mock her

We do not get a human life just for the asking
Birth in a human body is a reward for good deeds done in past births
Life waxes and wanes imperceptibly, it does not stay long
The leaf that is fallen does not return to the branch
Behold the ocean of transmigration with its irresistible tides
O Hari, pilot of my soul, swiftly conduct my passage to the farthest shore
Mirabai is a slave of Lord Giridhar, she says life lasts but a few days only

I remember how my mother would hold me
I would look up at her sometimes and see her weep  
I understand now what was happening
Love so strong it broke the cage
And she disappeared from everything for a moment
All actions have evolved from the taste of flight
The hope of freedom
Unable to live on the earth, Mirabai ventured out alone into the sky
I write of that journey, of becoming as free as God
Don't forget love, you will bring all the madness you need to unfill yourself across the universe

All my friends, what can you tell me of love
Whose pathways are filled with strangeness?
When you offer the Great One your love
At the first step your body is crushed  
Next, be ready to offer your head as a seat
Be ready to orbit his lamp like a moth giving in to the light
To live in the daring's love 
She runs towards the hunter's call
The partridge swallows hot coals
The love of the moon in a fish  
Kept from the sea, happily dies
Like a bee trapped for life in the closing of the sweet flower
Mirabai has offered herself to her Lord
She says, "The single lotus will swallow you whole"
