It was as if she was seeing the world for the first time. The sunlight danced on every leaf, every blade of grass, every droplet of morning dew. She understood now that this light was more than just sunlight - it was the very essence of God's creation.\n\nIn this moment of clarity, Maria saw how everything in nature moved in perfect harmony with this divine light. The swaying of the trees, the flight of birds, even the scurrying of small creatures on the forest floor - all were part of a grand, cosmic dance. She realized that everything was not just created by God, but was also one with God, inseparable and eternal.\n\nWith this newfound understanding, Maria began her descent down the mountain towards her village. Her steps were light, her heart full of the wonders she had witnessed. As she rounded a bend in the path, she came across an elderly woman. The woman was frail, her body bent with age, slowly making her way up the mountain with the aid of a gnarled wooden cane.\n\nAs the old woman looked up at Maria, her eyes widened in astonishment. For behind Maria, she saw a vision of Jesus, flanked by the archangels Michael and Gabriel. The divine light that Maria had seen in all of creation now seemed to emanate from her, visible to those with the eyes to see it.\n\nMoved by compassion, Maria approached the old woman. Without a word, she gently took the woman's hand in hers. In that instant, a warmth flowed between them, and the old woman felt strength return to her limbs. She straightened up, dropping her cane in surprise as she realized she no longer needed it.\n\nThe old woman looked at Maria with tears of joy and gratitude. Maria simply smiled, understanding now that she was a conduit for the healing light she had witnessed. As they parted ways, Maria continued her journey home, knowing that her life's purpose was only beginning to unfold.\n\n<p class=\"tetun\"></p>"
