Human: Write a creative bedtime story of 2000-2500 words long about {story_seed} for children of the {selected_culture} people in Timor-Leste. Whatever the story, replace the setting and character names with those appropriate to the {selected_culture} people. 
    
    Additionally, incorporate random elements from this text into your story: '{seed_file}'
    
    The story should be suitable for children and have a clear beginning, middle, and ending. Make sure the beginning, middle and end of the story are related to each other. Please provide the story in four or more parts, each around 400-500 words long. Also, provide a short title for the story. 
    
    Make aure there are AT LEAST 4 parts but there can be as many as 7. Each part should advance the plot while maintaining reader interest. Ensure the final part provides a satisfying conclusion to the story.
    Please follow this structure:
    
    Introduction: Set the scene and introduce the main character(s)
    2-4. Rising action: Develop the plot and present challenges
    Climax: Reach the height of tension or excitement
    Resolution: Wrap up the story with a satisfying ending
    
    After generating the story in English, translate it to Tetun. When translating, please consider the following Tetun grammar rules:
    
    1. Use subject-verb-object (SVO) word order as the default, but allow for object fronting when emphasizing or contrasting.
    2. Avoid passive voice constructions, as Tetun Dili lacks a passive voice. Use active constructions instead.
    3. Employ appropriate tense-aspect markers like ona (anterior), tiha (perfective), hela (continuous), and sei (future) to convey precise temporal and aspectual meanings.
    4. Use the focus marker mak to indicate emphasis or contrast where appropriate.
    5. Apply correct plural marking with sira and indicate definiteness using ne 'this' when needed.
    6. Incorporate Portuguese loanwords for formal or technical vocabulary, but maintain a balance with native Tetun words in everyday speech.
    7. Form possessive and associative constructions correctly, using nia for possessives and appropriate word order for associatives.
    8. Use the correct prepositions and conjunctions, many of which are borrowed from Portuguese (e.g. para 'so that', tanba 'because').
    9. Implement serial verb constructions for motion and direction (e.g. halai sai 'run exit' = 'run outside').
    10. Form questions, commands, and negations according to Tetun Dili grammar rules.
    11. Adjust language for different registers (formal, informal, church), using appropriate vocabulary and structures for each.
    12. Include discourse markers and connectors to improve cohesion (e.g. entaun 'so', maibe 'but', depois 'then').
    13. Use reduplication and compounding productively to form new words where appropriate (e.g. dader-dader 'every morning').
    14. Employ the correct forms of reflexives (-an suffix) and reciprocals (malu) when needed.
    15. Use appropriate numeral classifiers, especially for humans (e.g. ema nain rua 'person CLs:human two' = 'two people').
    16. Incorporate idiomatic "body-good" expressions for emotions and states (e.g. laran diak 'inside good' = 'kind-hearted').
    17. Use the existential verb iha correctly for existence, location, and possession.
    18. Form relative clauses using nebe or other appropriate markers.
    19. Use the irrealis marker atu for future events, intentions, or purposes.
    20. Incorporate appropriate intensifiers and comparatives (e.g. liu 'more', demais 'too much').
    
    21. Use the following example story in Tetum as a grammar reference. Do not include it as information for generating the story content.

    22. Do not use "posessor" for "teacher" unless it is a male teacher; while for female teacher you should write "profesora". "manorin" is a general term for both female and male teachers.
