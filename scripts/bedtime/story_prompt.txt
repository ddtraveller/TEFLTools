Human: Based on the source seed; '{seed_file}', write a creative bedtime story of 900-1200 words long for children of the {selected_culture} people in Timor-Leste with a spiritual dimension. However, the story does not need to take place in Timor Leste or be about the {selected_culture} people, it is simply for them. Try to appeal to, surprise and delight the {selected_culture} people by mixing a creative new storyline with traditional cultural undertones. 
    
    Additionally, incorporate this element into your story: {story_seed}
    
    The story should be suitable for young children and have a clear beginning, middle, and end. Please provide the story in three or more parts, each around 300-400 words long. Also, provide a short title for the story.
    
    After generating the story in English, translate it to Tetun. When translating, please consider the following Tetun grammar rules:
    
    1. Use subject-verb-object (SVO) word order as the default, but allow for object fronting when emphasizing or contrasting.
    2. Avoid passive voice constructions, as Tetun Dili lacks a passive voice. Use active constructions instead.
    3. Employ appropriate tense-aspect markers like ona (anterior), tiha (perfective), hela (continuous), and sei (future) to convey precise temporal and aspectual meanings.
    4. Use the focus marker mak to indicate emphasis or contrast where appropriate.
    5. Apply correct plural marking with sira and indicate definiteness using ne 'this' when needed.
    6. Incorporate Portuguese loanwords for formal or technical vocabulary, but maintain a balance with native Tetun words in everyday speech.
    7. Form possessive and associative constructions correctly, using nia for possessives and appropriate word order for associatives.
    8. Use the correct prepositions and conjunctions, many of which are borrowed from Portuguese (e.g. para 'so that', tanba 'because').
    9. Implement serial verb constructions for motion and direction (e.g. halai sai 'run exit' = 'run outside').
    10. Form questions, commands, and negations according to Tetun Dili grammar rules.
    11. Adjust language for different registers (formal, informal, church), using appropriate vocabulary and structures for each.
    12. Include discourse markers and connectors to improve cohesion (e.g. entaun 'so', maibe 'but', depois 'then').
    13. Use reduplication and compounding productively to form new words where appropriate (e.g. dader-dader 'every morning').
    14. Employ the correct forms of reflexives (-an suffix) and reciprocals (malu) when needed.
    15. Use appropriate numeral classifiers, especially for humans (e.g. ema nain rua 'person CLs:human two' = 'two people').
    16. Incorporate idiomatic "body-good" expressions for emotions and states (e.g. laran diak 'inside good' = 'kind-hearted').
    17. Use the existential verb iha correctly for existence, location, and possession.
    18. Form relative clauses using nebe or other appropriate markers.
    19. Use the irrealis marker atu for future events, intentions, or purposes.
    20. Incorporate appropriate intensifiers and comparatives (e.g. liu 'more', demais 'too much').
    
    21. Use the following example story in Tetum as a grammar reference. Do not include it as information for generating the story content.

    22. Do not use "posessor" for "teacher" unless it is a male teacher; while for female teacher you should write "profesora". "manorin" is a general term for both female and male teachers.
