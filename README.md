Focusing on places rather than people can change behaviors and reduce crime up to 35% in places where it has been used.

TimorLesteMap directory contains aws lambda code that updates a map with points of interest when you text a lattitude and longitude to a toll free number, +18445730801, that was set up in aws for the project. Access must be authorized before a phone number can use the toll free number. 

<img src="jpg/TL_mapper.jpg" alt="Map of Timor Leste with points of interest" width="400"/>

https://map.go-tl.com/

The code works by updating a csv in s3 that holds information about the points of interest. ex:

-8.651012,126.654322,crocodile,cadetblue

When the lambda gets a new text message (via pinpoint and sns), it adds the points of interest to the index.html.

First, it loads and pdf or text files with data relevant to the course. It can take about 10MB of data.
Then, it creates a syllabus. From the the data and the syllabus, it creates lesson plans.
It creates, readings, activities, multiple choice and fill in the blank quizzes in JSON format.
The quizzes can be used online or locally by students and are also suitable for use in LoRA fine tuning of a local LLM.
The courses in this repo were generated using AI and then a human to go back and edit and enrich the information.
It takes about 10 minutes and $1-4 USD to pay for calls to the model api although a local free LLM could be used.

### Aplikasaun LLM / LLM Applications

Konteúdu kursu no programa Python disponivel iha kódigu ida-ne'e ne'ebé fornese instrusaun, ezemplu no utilizasaun AI LLM. 
AI fó benefísiu barak ba edukasaun espesifikamente no jeralmente. Maske ida-ne'e mak software teknolojia ne'ebé avansadu liu no aas liu, maibé mós fasil liu atu hanorin no uza.
 
Course content and python programs are available in this code repo that provide instruction, examples and usage of AI LLMs.
AI provides many benefits for education specifically and in general. While this is some of the most advanced and highest technology software, it is also some of the easiest to teach and use.

### Aplikasaun LLM lokál no GPU / Local LLM Applications and GPUs

Modelu lian boot bele forte tebes maibé komputadór sira ne'ebé iha de'it CPU sei iha kapasidade limitadu atu hala'o sira. 
Presiza komputadór ho GPU sira atu aproveita hotu LLM no halo prosesu oioin. Mákina hirak-ne'e tenke fó dalan ba funsionáriu hanorin Timor-Leste atu produtivu liu hodi permite sira uza LLM maibé mós aplikasaun komputadór konvensiál liu hanesan uzasurat-tahan ka uza sira atu hala'o projector.
 
Large language models can be very powerful but computers with only a CPU will have a limited ability to run them.
Computers with GPUs are needed to take full advantage of an LLM and do other kinds of processing. These machines should enable Timor Leste teaching staff to be more productive by allowing them to use LLMs but also more conventional computer applications like using spreadsheets or using them to run a projector.

With that being said, GPU computers are very small now and will be otw to Timor Leste in October with the purpose of providing local LLM access. This means a chatbot that can understand and speak English and Portuguese when online and can understand written text offline and respond verbally and/or in text.

    prompt = f"""Given the following project information:
{truncated_info}
Please do the following:
1. Synthesize the key points and goals of the project
2. Localize the content for Timor Leste, considering cultural context and appropriateness
3. Create a well-structured syllabus for a program, including:
   - Course overview and objectives
   - A structure that includes a sequence of learning units (these can be called weeks, modules, or units)
   - For each learning unit, provide:
     * Clear objectives
     * Topics to be covered
     * Activities or assignments
   - Required resources (books, materials)
   - Suggested items to cover
   - Ideas for practical experience and community engagement
   - Resources

Format the output as Markdown, with clear headings and subheadings for each section. Use the following structure:

## Timor Ohin! / Timor Today!
In scripts/Timor_Today is an html file for a fake news website. It might be fun for members of the community or students to 'get hired' by the website and have them take some video cameras or just themselves around and report on the goings on in Timor Leste. This could be distributed over many P.C. sites or just one.
